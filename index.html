Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients can help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school canteen account on the on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements the may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handeling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again diversity is the key.

Once the student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps the school keep a record of the students' absenteesim. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish conectivity with the actualy concepts of there curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's enrollment, number, or name, details like avalibility in classes, numbers of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be a robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - Just after the admin enters the login details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and trasnparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real time status of leave requests and absenteesim in a confedential manner and at reduced costs.
